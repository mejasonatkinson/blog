I recently saw this comic, where a character is sitting at a computer talking to them self, saying how busy they are. Then another character comes along and asks "But are you productive?" and the first character replies "great! Now I’m busy and miserable". 

This got me thinking. What is it about productivity that makes us miserable, sad, or even frustrated? 

Let’s begin with a definition. What is productivity? 

Productivity is the efficiency of production of goods or services expressed by some measure.

So, if I understand this correctly one possible example is: 

A contractor made £3000 in 1 day. 

The measure being £3000 and the service being 1 day.

But does this way of thinking work in all instances? 

I personally don't think it does. 

Certain types of goods or services can not be effectivity measured easily, or the measurement variable may protray a false positive.

For example: 

A programmer wrote 3000 lines of code in 1 day. 

This sounds productive, but is it? Could they have solved the problem in less lines of code? Has adding so many lines of code, added bugs or vulnerabilities to the system they are working on? 

But the problem here is if I said: A programmer wrote 100 lines of code in 1 day compared to a programmer who wrote 3000 lines of code in 1 day. Who sounds more productive? 

From the perspective of some one who hasn't heard or understood about what I just said above, The programmer who produces the most sounds the most productive.

To give another real world example:

GitHub visually counts a developer’s contributions to the main branch of any repo they have contributed to on their profile. 

Does this show productivity?

From a employers point of view this could definitely be scene as such. 

But really all it tells the viewer is that the programmer has commited alot of code and that code has been added to the main branch of the given repos they have contributed too. It tells you nothing about the qualify of the code they have written.

Going back to my previous post on [social comparision](https://blog.jasonatkinson.co.uk/posts/the-og-social-comparers/), this could also lead developers and programmers to feel sad or frustrated effecting there self-esteem and possibly there performance in producing high quality code.

So how can we effectily messure productivity in this instances? It's difficult to say... But is something I wish to tackle.

Lets move onto a different topic: Learning.

How do we measure the productivity of a learner?

Using the same definition, a possible example could be:

A learner received an "A" on their Test.

The Test being the way we are measure the productivity, this could also be done through assessments, tasks, or projects. 

This is how educational institutions have been assessing their students performance since they where created. 

It is a little bit more complicated to do this when you are doing self led learning. How do you measure productivity in these instances?

I guess the best measure in these instances is projects, we can set ourselves to complete. 

But there are many protentional traps we can fall into even if we presume that projects are the best form of measuring learning. 

By our very nature we look for the easiest route to complete any given task. what do I mean by this? 

There is a difference between what is productive and what is easist. This is very dependent on what we know at the time of completing a project or task.

To give you an example of this, you have set yourself the task of printing out "hello" to a list of people by name in the console, but you only know how to use `console.log()`.

So you do this:

```
console.log('Hello James');
console.log('Hello Peter');
console.log('Hello Sam');
console.log('Hello Bill');
console.log('Hello Ryan');
```

This is the most productive method of doing this if you only know `console.log()`. but if you knew about arrays and for loops you would consider this to be a very unproductive aproach to the task.

In response, you might end up re-writing the code to look more like this:

```
const people = ["James", "Peter", "Sam", "Bill", "Ryan"];
for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    console.log("Hello " + people[i]);
}
```

Starting is normally the hardest part on the journey to becoming productive because naturally we wont do anything in the most productive way first time. Productivity comes with knowledge, which in turn comes from learning and studying. It is a cycle we must go on and one which seems to never end.

The second biggest problem on the road to productivity is the fact that you don't know, what you don't know. For this research is your friend, but that will only get you to a certain point. I think it is also important to have mentors, who can guide you into the right direction into what you should be learning and support you when you inevitably fall or tumble. 

On the Topic of failure, learning and productivity can also be halted if we struggle to make any progress, this goes back to the concept of doing what is easy. If we are struggling to learn something and have no support system or no obvious incentive, it is very easy to give up.

We have previously talked about how projects are potentially a good method for productivity but another very easy trap to fall into is measuring learning by time. Similar to how lines of code doesn't mean you are productive programmer, time spent learning can also be a bad indicator of productivity. 

By trying to learn fast, in an effort to be productive. You might watch, listen, or read things at such a pace, that you are not taking in or understanding the information you are trying to learn. And you are certainly not applying what you have learned, as that takes time too.

We are very good at tricking ourselves into thinking we are productive without really being productive. 

It’s a minefield of a topic which I have given a great deal of thought too.
