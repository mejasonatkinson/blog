For my first blog post, I thought I would start with the most pressing of questions; why am I starting a blog? 

I have started many blogs over the past years, ranging from a blog, tracking my creative summer holiday project; to keeping a blog as my sketchbook throughout the 3 years of my bachelor’s degree; and even a 30-day mini challenge blog, where I blogged every day for 30 days.

Each one came to a natural conclusion, and so I stopped blogging. But this time, there is no set end date. 
I am starting this blog for a few reasons but first I want to acknowledge that without some encouragement I wouldn’t have even reached this far. 

Since leaving university, my career has taken me in many twists and turns, but one thing which has been consistent is the fact that whatever I do I strive to learn and improve. This has led me to question how much dyslexia and dyspraxia plays a role in my learning as someone who is neurodiverse; and in relation to this the field in which I work in web development is a fast pace and rapidly changing industry. Because of these factors I feel like I should be recording my thoughts on these and more wider subjects and advocate for learning, tech, development, equity, inclusion & diversity. And that is what I hope to start to do here.
