For my first post, I thought I would start with the most pressing of questions; why am I starting a blog? 

I have started many over the past 2 decades, ranging from, tracking my summer holiday project; to keeping a blog as my sketchbook throughout the 3 years of my bachelor’s degree; and even as 30-day mini challenge, where I posted every day for 30 days, just to see if I could.

Each one came to a natural conclusion, and so I stopped. But this time, there is no set end date. 

I am starting this blog for a few reasons but first I want to acknowledge that without some encouragement I wouldn’t have even reached this point. 

Since leaving university, my career has taken me in many twists and turns, but one thing which has been consistent is the fact that whatever I do I strive to learn and improve. This has led me to question how much dyslexia and dyspraxia plays a role in my learning as someone who is neurodiverse. 

Being a web developer also adds to my need to understand how we learn, why we learn and why we forget, as the industry rapidly changes. 

As such, I feel that I should be recording my thoughts on these and more wider ranging subjects. Advocating for learning in the tech and development communities for inclusion & diversity as a way to just organise my thoughts.
