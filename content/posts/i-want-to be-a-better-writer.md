<!-- Blog Post #10 -->

This blog post marks my tenth entry in this latest encarnation of my endever to keep a blog, and as such I have been doing some reflecting.

Ever since, secondary school I have tried to follow a set structure when it comes to writing non-fiction. 

## PEC

PEC, stands for Point, Evidence, Comment. This is also very similar to PEE, which stands for Point, Evidence, Explain.

### P

Point, is the "why" of your agruement. 

The point of this blog post is that I have been reflecting on what I have written, and I want to explain how I currently write in an attempt to better cement, my blogging style and the struggles I have been experiencing in an attempt to create better content as I feel that so far what I have written hasn't been successful. 

### E

Evidence, is the proof, that can support my point.

In the 10 posts that I have writen so far: 

- 4 are primary focused on Neurodiversity.
- 1 is primary focused on Learning.
- 1 is primary focused on Neurodiversity and Learning.
- 1 is primary focused on Programming and Learning.
- 1 is primary focused on Programming.
- 1 is primary focused on introductioning my blog.

I did not set any measurable goals for success in keeping this blog apart from keeping to a regular schedule.

In the last week or two, this has even been tricky because I have been away on holiday.

I did try to write and plan my blog posts 2 to 3 weeks in advance, but due to time limitations. What used to be **pro-active** is now become **re-active**.

In my first posted I stated that this blog would be themed around the topics of neurodiversity and learning.

According to LinkedIn my first post had 925 views and 4 comments. The following posts, views range from 300 to 100. None of which had any comments.

I also link to my posts on Twitter, views vary from 5 all the way to the dizzy heights of 17. It is intresting to note that the Tweet that had 17 views was the only one which I included an image on. Only my most recent post on dyspraxia has any interaction.

### C

Comment, is a summary of how my evidence backs up my point.

In conclusion, I think it was a mistake to not set stronger, more measurable goals, however the evidence presented does seem to lean towards the fact that I have kept to my orginal promise of writing about neurodiversity and learning. However, is there an audience for this type of content? The socail analytics, seems to represent a view that the content I am creating or the way in which I am sharing or presenting my content is a problem.

As some possible outcomes:

- I think I should do more research into whether there is an audience for the type of content I am producing and how it is presented, and a formula for creating content.
- The way in which I share my content needs to change.
- Setting myself critia for what a success looks like for me, will help to guide my writing.

Thanks you for spending the time to read my rabblings, I hope they will get better soon.
