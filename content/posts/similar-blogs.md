<!-- Blog Post #13 -->

What is my inspiration? Who do I follow, Why do I follow them? How do they approach writing or doing what they do... All good questions. And some of which I hope to answer here.

My first, and probably biggest mistake. I might be making is I don't follow any bloggers. or atleast, I don't follow them directly from there blog.

I used too back when google had an amazing rss reader, but when they killed that it became much harder to manage and then the ads revolution happened, completely killing the experience.

So how do I follow people? Mostly I follow them on twitter, youtube and more recently twitch.
