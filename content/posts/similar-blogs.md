<!-- Blog Post #13 --> 

What is my inspiration? Who do I follow, Why do I follow them? How do they approach writing or doing what they do... All good questions. And some of which I hope to answer here.

My first, and probably biggest mistake. I might be making is I don't follow any bloggers. or atleast, I don't follow them directly from there blog.

I used too back when google had an amazing rss reader, but when they killed that it became much harder to manage and then the ads revolution happened, completely killing the experience.

So how do I follow people? Mostly I follow them on Twitter, Youtube and more recently Twitch.

Who do I follow?

I feel like I follow alot of people which fall under the sub-topics in which this blog is primary focused on (Learning, Development & Diversity).

Probably the first of which I found what "the dyslexic developer"

At the time I didn't really know many developers, often playing the role of a full stack developer at every company I worked at.

"the dyslexic developer" website is simplistic, which I like. he wrote 22 blog posts in the space of 2 years, from 2018 to 2020. before switching format to podcasts and twitch.

He also doesn't mention anything about being dyslexic in his writing.

You can find his website here: [dyslexicdeveloper.com](https://www.thedyslexicdeveloper.com/)

As I carried on my search I did find one other, "Jennifer Opal"

She is very active on twitter. Her profile states she is a DevOps Engineer with AuDHD, Dyslexia and Dyspraxia. 

I think she likes to switch things up alot on here blog/website as I just checked and it looks different to how I remeber it... but maybe that is just me.

She has written 8 blog posts in 5 years. And focuses on diversity, inclusion, learning and development. Which is far more the same direction. I want to go in. It is only a shame that she hasn't produced more content. 

You can find her website here: [jenniferopal.com](https://jenniferopal.com/)

But as I do more and more research for this blog post I find so many small, abandoned blogs on the internet. 

What makes it so difficult to keep a blog going?

I'm finding it hard to find inspiration. Maybe thats what makes blogging so hard. Maybe I shouldn't be thinking of the audience and just think of this as a public journal?
