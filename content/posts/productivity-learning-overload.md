I recently saw this comic, where a character is sitting at a computer talking to them self, saying how busy they are then another character comes along and asks "But are you productive?" and the first character replies "great. Now I’m busy and miserable". 

This got me thinking. What is it about productivity that makes us miserable, sad, or even frustrated? 

Let’s begin with a definition. What is productivity? 

Productivity is the efficiency of production of goods or services expressed by some measure.

So, if I understand this correctly one possible example is: A contactor made £3000 in 1 day. The measure being £3000 and the service being 1 day.

But using this as a bases for our understanding, I think is wrong because certain types of goods or services can not be effectivity measured easily, or the measurement variable may protray a false postive.

For example: 

A programmer wrote 3000 lines of code in 1 day. 

This sounds productive, but is it? Could they have solved the problem in less lines of code? Has adding so many lines of code, added bugs or vulnerabilities to the system they are working on? 

But the problem here is if I said: A programmer wrote 100 lines of code in 1 day compared to a programmer who wrote 3000 lines of code in 1 day. Who sounds more productive? 

To give another real world example:

GitHub visually counts a developer’s contributions to the main branch of any repo they have contributed to on their profile. Does this show productivity?

From a employers point of view this could defiantly be scene as such. 

But really all it tells the viewer is that the programmer has commited alot of code and that code has been added to the main branch of the given repos they have contributed too.

Going back to my previous post of socail comparsion, this could also lead developers and programmers to feel sad or frustrated effecting there self-esteem and possibly there performance in producing high quality code.

So how can we effectily messure productivity in this instances? It's difficult to say.

Moving away from this, side tangent. 

How do we measure the productivity of a learner?

Using the same definition, a possible example could be:

A learner received an "A" on their computer science test.

The test being the way we are measuring the productivity, this could also be done throught assetsments, tasks, or projects. This is how educational institutions have been assessing there students performance since they where created.

It is alittle bit more complicated to do this when you are doing self lead learning. How do you measure productivity in these instances?

There is also alot of traps you can fall into a common one is measuring the productivity by the wrong thing. Similar to how lines of code doesn't mean you are productive, time spent or courses taken are bad measurements of productivity in learning, for example:

I have learned how to program in React, Vue, and Angular in 6 months. 

This sounding productive but might not be productive as your learning hasn’t been assessed and how much could you have learned about these frameworks, within that time frame.

To try and learn faster, to be productive. You might watch, listen, or read things at such a pace, that you are not taking in or understanding the information you are trying to learn. And you are certainly not applying what you have learned, as that takes time too.

You might even turn to productivity tools that summarize books, long blog posts or videos in the aim of save time reading, but does it?

We are very good at tricking ourselves into thinking we are productive without really being productive. 

It’s a minefield of a topic but an important one, as IF we want to continue to learn and improve.
