This is my second attempt of writing this. I stopped and deleted my first attempt when I saw that it had reached over a thousand words, and I couldn’t see an end in sight. The problem is I have a lot to say on the topic. But I also want to write this blog in such a way that each post is bitesize, and easily digestible. And I guess in a way I want to write it in a format that helps me organise my ideas, to better understand myself, but also for others to better understand what it is like to be dyslexic.

So, in basic terms, what is dyslexia… 

If you look up the origin of the word, according to [UNESCO](https://mgiep.unesco.org/article/about-dyslexia)

The word 'dyslexia' is derived from the Latin word 'dys', which translates to 'difficult', and the Greek word 'lexia', which translates to 'words'; it literally means, “difficulty with words”.

From a very base level, that is what it is. Why and how we have 'difficulty with words' I will save for future blog posts as I could write thousands of words on each.

Using a different resource; [the NHS’s conditions, definition]( https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dyslexia/)

Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that mainly causes problems with reading, writing and spelling.

Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn't affected.

This opens more questions than answers, but I think its important to highlight how big institutions such as the NHS perceive it. So, we can build on this as we explore the topic more. 

Some of the questions I have, straight away are...

- What is the difference between a difficulty and a disability?
- How is reading, writing, and spelling effected? 
- How does learning or intelligence play into this?
- What adverse consequences, does being seen as dyslexic have on people’s psychology and behaviour? 

... Just to list a few. 

Next week I want to tackle, how is reading, writing, and spelling effected. and how this plays a role in the way we (dyslexics) learn.
