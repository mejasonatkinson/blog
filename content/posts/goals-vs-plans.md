<!-- Blog Post #11 -->

Last week as you might have been able to tell I was reflecting, on what I have done over the last 9/10 weeks (depending on how you look at it). I concluded with some some possibly outcomes. In one of the last sentences of the post I said I needed to set myself critia for what success looks like for me, to guide me into hopefully producing better content. And for the following week I have been thinking alot about goals. Specifically SMART goals.

SMART goals stand for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-bound. This sounds awesome! but to me this sounds more like a plan than a goal? In my experience a goal is a hope, for example: "I want to gain 1000 follows by the end of the year". This isn't a SMART goal but I would defiently define it as a goal. But a plan would have Specific, Measurable, Realistic Steps to take. Possibly set to a Time-frame. Sounds very familiar?

The word 'goal' is defined as (noun)
The object of a person's ambition or effort; an aim or desired result.

The word 'plan' is defined as (noun)
A detailed proposal for doing or achieving something.

So what are my plans for this blog. As I said previously I set out with the goal to make this a pro-active blog, in terms of having content prepared and planned out weeks in advice, for me this was 1 week in advance; but that meant any distractions to my schedule could shift my writing to be re-active, putting myself under unnecessary pressure. 

So, my first new plan, is to, have prepared atleast 4 blog posts in advance, with the continued weekly posting schedule.

Specific: Blog Posts.
Measurable: 4.
Attainable: Yes.
Time Frame: Weekly.

My second new plan, is to gather resources and research in advanced, by spending a miumium of 2 evenings a week, looking for potential talking points and reviewing what similar blogs are also writing about with the aim to find a miumium of 2 quotes an evening.

Specific: Gather resources and research.
Measurable: 2 quotes, a evening
Attainable: Yes.
Time Frame: Twice Weekly.

My third plan, is to measure each blog post against critia that I create for what I consider a successful blog post is.

This is in its current state; not very Specific or Measurable, atleast until I think about the critia, its not Attainable, and has no Time Frame. So this plan has alot of room for improvement. 

I have alot of goals currently, but none of them are going anywhere or going to be completed because I don't have a plan that is specific enought, but if I did have a specific enough plan... I wouldn't be setting it as a goal. I would just be doing it! 

As nike's slogan says "Just do it!" Thats what I hope to do here.
