In the last 2 decades, there has been an increase in awareness of social comparison or to give its proper name social comparison theory. This is due, in no small part because of social media platforms. These platforms make it easier than ever to compare ourselves to the "ideal", this is mostly always done in what is called a upward comparison.

Upwards comparison is the process of comparing ourselves, consciously or subconsciously to individuals or groups that we perceive as superior or better than ourselves, in some cases this leads to self-improvement to try and become an equal or better than the person we are comparing ourselves too. But the majority of upward comparisons are made when the individual is feeling lesser and therefore evoke a negative reaction, effecting our self-esteem.

Social comparison with peers on social media can also lead to feelings of self-pity or satisfaction. The desire for social comparison can cause FoMO and compulsive checking of social media sites.

These are just a handful of examples of why, I don’t look at or use Facebook or Instagram, I have even stubbled into some problems with comparing myself to others on LinkedIn.

But my problems with social comparison, pre-dates the social network revolution.

Neurodivergent people, really don’t have to look far to see that they are different, we are the OG, social comparers. We don’t even have to look at our phones! 

What am I talking about? Well let me explain…

I am going to use dyslexia and dyspraxia, as use cases. As they are the areas, I am most familiar with.

A quick google search and a look at the NHS’s conditions page about [dyslexia symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dyslexia/symptoms/), it states:

- Pre-school symptoms can include delayed speech development **compared** with other children of the same age.
- Primary school symptoms can include problems copying written language and **taking longer than normal** to complete written work.
- Teenagers and adult symptoms can include trying to avoid reading and writing whenever possible… **I wonder why?**

We don’t even have to social compare ourselves. Other people do it for us, but even without them we can see and understand that something is different about us? But we try to strive to an "ideal" which is beyond our reach and doing so, effecting our self-esteem. By early adulthood we have already developed an avoidance mechanism.

This could easily lead to just thinking of ourselves as stupid. The only reason I don’t think this is because of a single line which is often repeated. “Intelligence isn’t affected”. This allowed me to have a growth mindset (however my take on the subject, is a little bit different than most; I might talk about it in its own post, later). This has allowed me to look at upwards comparison, at least in **some instances** as a motivator for self-improvement. 

Another quick google search and a look at the NHS’s conditions page about [dyspraxia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia/symptoms/), is not any better; you will find many hints at the fact that we will try and avoid joining in or taking part in games or activities as it will highlight how different we are.

There are probably many more examples of social comparison in all the conditions that fall under the neurodivergent term, but as I have less experience with them, I didn’t want to include them here as I don’t want to miscommunicate them.

One more thing which I do want to talk about before I finish this post, is the idea of role models. 

Normally, when the topic of dyslexia or dyspraxia is brought up a list of famous, successful people often follow. 

Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, Orlando Bloom, Tom Cruise, Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, Leonardo Da Vinci, Mozart, George Washington, Daniel Radcliffe, Cara Delevingne, David Bailey, Bill Gates, Isaac Newton, Pablo Picasso, Robin Williams, Stephen Fry, Eddie Izzard, Cher, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Edison.

Most of the time, these people appear on different lists for dyslexia, dyspraxia or even dyscalculia but whether they fall under any of these neurological terms, is at best a guess.  Some have spoken about the troubles they face, which could lead us to presume that they fall under the definition of one of the terms. But that still means very little because you can be severely dyslexic, or mildly dyslexic, or anywhere in between. Knowing that someone might have dyslexia, doesn’t at all mean that you can achieve their level of success and there are possibly billions of other variables to consider such as there upbring or outlook on life. You might have also noticed that this list of people with 1 or 2 exceptions is not very diverse, and it could be asked what role did that play into their success?

Clearly, I have a lot to say on the matter. But to conclude this conversation, I want to just openily ask, What can I do to make social comparison, a positive experience? Instead of what I currently do which is try and avoid it?

It is sometimes said that comparison is the thief of joy. So why do we do it? What is the point of social comparison? And how does that play a role in being neurodiverse.
