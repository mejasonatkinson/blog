Simlar to Dyslexia, I have a lot to say about Dyspraxia, but lets start with the basics.

What is Dyspraxia?

If you look up the origin of the word, dyspraxia according to [UNESCO](https://mgiep.unesco.org/article/about-dyspraxia)

The word 'dyspraxia' is derived from the Greek word 'duspraxia'. 

'Dys' means 'impaired', 'ill' or 'abnormal'. 

'Praxis' means 'to act'. 

So the literal meaning of dyspraxia is 'ill-doing' or 'abnormal act'.

This in itself is confusing? because if you look at when I defined [dyslexia](https://blog.jasonatkinson.co.uk/posts/dyslexia-what-is-it/) using **UNESCO** as the source. 

'Dys' in 'Dyslexia' means 'difficult'?

'apraxia' according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apraxia) is a term which comes from Greek and means 'without action'

Overall I am confused what Dyspraxia even means, this might be why it is also now refered to as DCD.

DCD stands for Developmental co-ordination disorder and comes with the added bonus that I don't have to know Greek to know what that means. ðŸ˜‚

What comes to mind when you think about co-ordination?

[NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia/symptoms/) List Symptoms, by developmental age.

Infants Symptoms include:
- Delays in reaching normal developmental milestones (rolling, sitting, crawling, walking)
- Difficulty playing with toys or eat with cutlery that require **fine-motor skills**.

Older Children Symptoms include:
- Difficulty with activities and keeping still.

Being generally awkward and clumsy, bumping into objects, dropping things, falling over are all **possible** signs.

There are many additional **problems** that can spring up.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder), talks about alot of the topics covered above breaking it down into gross and fine motor skills, memory, sensory, hypotonia, developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD) and other associated disorders and secondary consequences. It is worth a read if you have the time.

It is very easy to say that having or being dyspraxic is a negative thing. But it is important to say that we can build systems to manage all of these issues and most of the time you wouldn't even notice these problems unless you watch us closely.

Common strengths we have, are normally within the areas of leadership, empathy, strategy and problem solving. Why these are seen as strengths, I would like to explore more at some point.

There is a lot to unpack here and go into more detail about but for a first entry into the topic, I think this is an overall good outline of what I believe dyspraxia is or can be at present.
