If you go back to the earliest form of humanity. Learning took place by a person passing knowledge to another: via showing or explaining. And the student, learned by listening, watching, and doing, repeatedly until they master what they are being taught.

At the same time, these early humans would create pictorial drawings showing what they have done, this eventually led to a logographic writing system. Other areas of the world developed other writing systems using an alphabetic writing system.

Why, the adoption of an alphabetic system, over a logographic writing system? Simple, it’s faster for most people to process. Like how a qwerty keyboard makes it faster for humans to type.

And that is where the problem is, some peoples brains (mine included) can’t process alphabetic systems; we are trying to process it as a pictorial image, which slows our processing speed down and intern slows our learning capacity down. 

Because of these different writing systems, it is possible to be dyslexic in one language and not in another language. But it is defiantly a lot more prominent in the English alphabetic system. 

So, what can we do about it? How can people like me learn effectively in a culture that uses a language system that is working against how our brains work? What type of learner am I? 

All good questions.

I personaly think that most of these questions can be answered atleast in a very basic way by examining how humans where learning before books and written instructions became the domaniate method of learning. 

In away calling dyslexia a learning difficulty is missleading because dyslexics can learn just as well as anyone else; it is obsicales put in our way that is the problem.

I feel like there is also something to be said about how much we learned historicly compared to how much we are expected to learn today. Where as in the past you could be a master in one thing. In the modern world, you are expected to have a 'degree' of mastery in 8 to 11 different subjects before you are even 16 years old! With tests and exams, there is a culture of JIT (Just-In-Time) learning, craming/revising which is at odds with the way a dyslexic brain works. 

Overall, if I had to sumarize my thoughts, the world has seen a culture shift in what is seen as important; mainly in part to the accessibly to information. The problem is that the accesiblity to the information, is not accesible for all, which has turned humanity into a us (neurodiverse) and them (nuerotypical) style thinking. The accessible learning, the better it is for all of use.
