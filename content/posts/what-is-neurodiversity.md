In my first post I mentioned that I am dyslexic and dyspraxic; so, I thought the best topic to tackle first is what is neurodiversity and how does that fit in?

If we break the word down. Neuro: refers to neurology, which is the study of how our nerves and brains work. Diversity; means variety, different from the typical or standard. So put together Neurodiversity, simply means our nerves and brains work differently.  

There are many different types of neurodiversity, but as a basic guide, below is a short list of the main types.

-	Dyscalculia
-	Dyslexia (that’s me!)
-	ADHD
-	Tourette Syndrome
-	Acquired Neurodiversity
-	Mental Health
-	Autism Spectrum Condition
-	DCD / Dyspraxia (that’s also me!)

I want to investigate and write about all of these and more, at some point. It's a huge topic, which really needs to be broken down into many pieces and many posts. To fully explore not just the neurological impact but also there psychological and behaviour impact.
