In my first post I mentioned that I am dyslexic and have dyspraxia; so, I thought the best topic to tackle first is to talk about the wider context these things belong.

What is neurodiversity?

If we break the word down. Neuro: refers to neurology, which is the study of how our nerves and brains work. Diversity; means variety, different from the typical or standard. So put together Neurodiversity, simply means our nerves and brains work differently.  

There are many different types of neurodiversity, but as a basic guide, below is a short list of the main types.

-	Dyscalculia
-	Dyslexia (that’s me!)
-	ADHD
-	Tourette Syndrome
-	Acquired Neurodiversity
-	Mental Health
-	Autism Spectrum Condition
-	DCD / Dyspraxia (that’s also me!)

I want to investigate and write about all of these and more, at some point. It's a huge topic, which really needs to be broken down into many pieces to fully explore not just the neurological impact but also there psychological and behavioural impact.

One of the above items I want to quickly expand on, is what "Acquired Neurodiversity" is?

This covers a huge range of neurological conditions including but not limited to: Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Cerebral Palsy and Alzheimer’s disease. As well as Neurodiverse conditions acquired via Strokes, and other types of brain damage, either by an accident or some other means.
