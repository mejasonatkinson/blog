This is a little bit different from my previous posts because in this post, I wanted to start tackling the topic of how can we be more productive learners.

I think understanding how we learn is key to figuring out how to be productive learner. And in doing so I hope to understand myself better.

Marty Lobdell's lecture on the topic of Studying has been viewed more than 22 Million times on YouTube.

You time have already noticed that what I am hoping to do is learn about the science of learning, but the lecture is about studying.

What is the difference between learning and studying?

[Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/How-to-Use-Learn-and-Study-) says: Learning means to gain knowledge or skill by studying.

This implies that studying is the process, action or journey you take to learn.

The rest of this blog post is going to be my notes on the lecture with my thoughts, where I feel required or think I can add value.
