This is a little bit different from my previous posts because I wanted to start tackling the topic of how can we be more productive learners.

I think understanding how we learn is key to figuring out how to be a productive learner.

Marty Lobdell's lecture on the topic of Studying has been viewed more than 22 Million times on YouTube.

You might have already noticed that I said I want to be a productive learner, but the lecture is about studying.

What is the difference between learning and studying?

[Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/How-to-Use-Learn-and-Study-) says: Learning means to gain knowledge or skill by studying.

This implies that studying is the process, action or journey you take to learn.

The rest of this post is dedicated to my notes on Marty Lobdell's lecture, with my thoughts sprinkled in, where I feel needed.

The lecture, describes indirectly the use of the **Pomodoro Technique**. Studying in short, intervals to help prevent state-dependent memory loss. And rewarding oneself after completing a chunk of studying in order to keep motivation high.

They also talk about the importance of **Habit Creation**, to avoid distraction. Such as a study lamp, where when you have the lamp turned on, you associate it with studying and when you are finished studying the lamp is turned off.

They go on to discuss how Rote Memorization, is generally not a very efficient way of learning, this is made even more so by Dyslexia and Dyspraxia. 

It was intresting to hear about how when learning we should first try and conclude if something is fact or a concept. In Web development there are many concepts, on how best to write code, but the code itself is a fact.

It is sometimes asked does having dyslexia or dyspraxia make remebering facts and concepts harder? and in a sense it does, it is said that we remeber things in terms of stories, which brings to mind the **Memory Palace Technique**.

Marty Lobdell gives examples of how studying with others can help students remember information more effectively. This brings to mind the importance of **Mentors** and **community**. It is very easy to miss or miss-understand something and in these instances help from fellow learners is probably the best method to getting unstuck and progressing.

The importance of active recitation when studying, is also brought up. This brings to mind the topics of **Learning-by-doing** and the **learning pyramid**.

Marty Lobdell suggests that by studying less and instead relying on questioning, one is more likely to find the information they're looking for.

This reminds me of a quote assigned to Albert Einstein, "The important thing is not to stop **questioning**. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."

In his closing statements he discusses how the brain is often tricked into remembering things incorrectly because of the similarity between two things. Which makes me think about what I have previously said about **productivity** and how we can trick ourselves into beleiving we have been productive, when We have gained, little or no expierence.
